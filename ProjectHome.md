This is a GAE application, available at http://quizlink.appspot.com

Allows users to create, take, and share quizzes.

  * Supports "retry mode", which asks questions until all are answered correctly.

  * Questions can be fill-in-the-blank, multiple choice single response ("choose one"), or multiple choice multiple response ("choose all that apply").

  * Past sessions and individual responses are tracked so users can monitor their own progress. Session history and responses are not visible to other users.

  * Users can maintain a private list of quizzes, or the quizzes can be published to a public list to make them available to all users.

  * Supports comments on questions, for the purpose of challenging the answers or suggesting corrections to the quiz author.

  * "Auto quiz" will sample questions from selected quizzes, using an algorithm that varies the probability of a question being asked depending on how long it has been since the question was answered, and how many times the question was answered incorrectly.
